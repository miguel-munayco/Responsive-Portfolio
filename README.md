# Responsive-Portfolio
The motivation for this project was to create a website which gives potential future employers a chance to view your profile. The website includes a section describing the creator of the project, a section showcasing their previous projects and skills, and a section detailing how the website creator can be contacted. The purpose and reason for building this project is to showcase the skills you as a coder possess. Employers have a clear idea of your intentions and who you are as a person, as well as the website being proof of your range of abilities and what you can do. Benefits of creating a website of your own as a coder include the opportunity to personalise the website, being able to quickly make any changes necessary, and becoming more knowledgeable on coding and design.
Designing and coding a website should be essential amongst coders, as it encourages individuality and creativity.
